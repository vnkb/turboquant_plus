# TurboQuant Diagnostic Scripts

Hardware profiling, benchmarking, and quality validation for TurboQuant cache types.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus.git
cd turboquant_plus

# 2. Run the diagnostic
bash scripts/turbo-diag /path/to/llama.cpp /path/to/model.gguf
```

That's it. The launcher automatically:
1. Finds or creates an isolated Python venv (`.turbo-diag-venv/`)
2. Installs `rich` for a color-coded terminal UI (falls back to ASCII if it fails)
3. Runs the full diagnostic suite

**Estimated runtime:** 20–40 minutes depending on hardware. Use `--skip-ppl` and `--skip-stress` to cut that roughly in half.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, a built llama.cpp with turbo3 support, and a `.gguf` model file.

## How to Read Results

The `.txt` log is organized into 13 numbered sections. Here's what to look at, in order of importance:

### Check quality first (Section 10)

Perplexity (PPL) must be within 2% of q8_0. **If PPL is broken, all speed numbers are meaningless.**

### Decode speed — the critical metric (Section 7)

This is the test that matters most. Look at the turbo3/q8_0 ratio at each context depth:

- **Healthy (M5 Max):** `0.92x (short) → 0.72x (48K)` — gradual, predictable degradation
- **Problem (M1):** `0.90x (short) → 0.09x (42K)` — constant cache thrashing, falls off a cliff

### Prefill speed (Section 6)

turbo3/q8_0 ratio should be flat at 0.95–1.00x across all depths. If it degrades with context length, that's a context scaling regression.

### Stress test inflection point (Section 8)

Fine-grained decode scaling gradient. Shows the exact context depth where turbo3 decode starts falling apart. This is the most useful data for diagnosing constant cache issues on specific hardware.

### Thermal comparison (Sections 2 vs 12)

Compare pre-benchmark and post-benchmark system load. If `CPU_Speed_Limit` dropped below 100 during the test, results may be artificially low due to thermal throttling.

### Memory breakdown (Section 11)

KV cache sizing at multiple context lengths. If the system is near its `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`, swap pressure will kill decode performance.

### Section-by-Section Reference

| Section | Title | What It Tells You |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Hardware Inventory | CPU, RAM, GPU, cache hierarchy, and power state (no PII) |
| 2 | System Load (pre-benchmark) | Baseline load, memory pressure, top CPU consumers, and disk I/O |
| 3 | Model Info | Model architecture, params, layer count, expert count, and file type |
| 4 | GPU Device Capabilities | GPU family, Metal version, Tensor API support, and unified memory |
| 5 | Build Validation | Confirms turbo3 type is available, Metal library loads, and build commit |
| 6 | Prefill Speed | Prefill tok/s at 2K/4K/8K/16K/32K for q8_0, turbo3, and mode 2 |
| 7 | Decode Speed | Decode tok/s at short/4K/8K/16K/32K — **the critical test** |
| 8 | Constant Cache Stress Test | Fine-grained decode gradient at 2K–32K in ~2K increments |
| 9 | Combined Prefill+Decode | Realistic workload simulation (prefill then decode) |
| 10 | Perplexity | Quality validation — PPL for q8_0, turbo3, and turbo3 mode 2 |
| 11 | Memory Breakdown | KV cache sizing at multiple context lengths |
| 12 | System Load (post-benchmark) | Post-test load, thermal throttling check |
| 13 | Diagnostic Summary | All anomalies, how-to-read guide, and next steps |

## Known Baselines

### M5 Max Reference Numbers (Qwen 35B MoE Q8_0)

| Metric | Expected | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Prefill ratio (turbo3/q8_0) | 0.95–1.00x | Flat across all depths |
| Decode ratio (short context) | ~0.92x | Small overhead from WHT transform |
| Decode ratio (32K context) | ~0.75x | Gradual degradation, still usable |
| PPL delta vs q8_0 | < 2% | Typically < 1% |

### What "Good" vs "Bad" Looks Like

| Indicator | Good | Bad |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Decode ratio curve | Gradual slope, stays above 0.70x at 32K | Cliff drop below 0.50x at any depth |
| Prefill ratio | Flat 0.95–1.00x | Drops with context depth |
| PPL delta | < 2% | > 5% (quality regression) |
| CPU Speed Limit | 100 before and after | Drops below 90 during test |
| Swap growth | < 50 MB | > 100 MB (memory pressure) |

### Anomaly Flags

The diagnostic auto-detects these issues and tags them `[ANOMALY]` in the log:

- **Steep decode degradation** — ratio drops >15% between consecutive depths
- **Thermal throttling** — `CPU_Speed_Limit` dropped below 100%
- **Memory pressure/swapping** — swap grew >100 MB during benchmarks
- **Low q8_0 baseline** — system was under load (q8_0 decode < 5 tok/s)
- **Quality regression** — turbo3 PPL >10% worse than q8_0
- **Unreliable 1K measurement** — Metal async dispatch artifact (>10,000 tok/s at 1K context)

## Hardware Replay System

The `hw_replay.py` module (`turboquant/hw_replay.py`) parses diagnostic output into structured Python objects for programmatic analysis.

### Load a diagnostic profile

```python
from turboquant.hw_replay import HardwareProfile

profile = HardwareProfile.from_diag_file("turbo-diag-20260326.txt")

# Or from the JSON profile
profile = HardwareProfile.from_json("turbo-hwprofile-20260326.json")
```

### Extract performance curves

```python
# Decode speed vs context depth
decode_curve = profile.get_decode_curve("turbo3")
# {0: 42.1, 4096: 38.7, 8192: 35.2, ...}

# turbo3/q8_0 ratio at each depth
ratio_curve = profile.get_ratio_curve("turbo3", "q8_0", "decode")
# {0: 0.92, 4096: 0.89, 8192: 0.85, ...}

# Find the inflection point (where decode falls off a cliff)
inflection = profile.find_decode_inflection("turbo3")
# 16384  (or None if the curve is smooth)
```

### Compare two profiles

```python
from turboquant.hw_replay import compare_profiles

m5 = HardwareProfile.from_diag_file("diag-m5-max.txt")
m1 = HardwareProfile.from_diag_file("diag-m1-ultra.txt")

report = compare_profiles(m5, m1)
print(report.to_markdown())
```

### Predict performance on untested hardware

```python
from turboquant.hw_replay import predict_decode_from_baseline

# Predict M1 (family 1007, no tensor API) from M5 baseline
predicted = predict_decode_from_baseline(
    baseline=m5,
    target_gpu_family_id=1007,
    target_has_tensor=False,
)
# {0: 0.92, 4096: 0.85, 8192: 0.71, 16384: 0.34, ...}
```

## Before You Run

**Plug in your charger and close heavy apps.** On Apple Silicon Macs, battery power triggers CPU/GPU throttling that produces artificially low speed numbers — we observed 2-3x slower benchmarks on an M5 Max running on battery vs plugged in. The diagnostic will detect throttling (`CPU_Speed_Limit` in Section 12), but the damage is already done to earlier results. NVIDIA laptops have similar power management behavior.

Close Chrome, video calls, and anything GPU-heavy before running. The diagnostic captures top CPU/GPU consumers (Section 2), so interference will be visible in the log, but clean results are always better.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "turbo3 not recognized" or cache type errors

Your llama.cpp build doesn't have turbo types compiled in. Rebuild with the TurboQuant patches applied:

```bash
cd /path/to/llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_METAL=ON -DGGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

### "No .gguf model found"

The auto-detection searches `llama.cpp/models/`, `../models/`, and `~/local_llms/models/`. If your model lives somewhere else, pass the path explicitly:

```bash
bash scripts/turbo-diag ~/llama.cpp /path/to/your/model.gguf
```

### Benchmarks are painfully slow

Use the skip flags to cut runtime roughly in half:

```bash
bash scripts/turbo-diag ~/llama.cpp model.gguf --skip-ppl --skip-stress
```

PPL tests take ~10 minutes, and the stress test adds another ~10 minutes of fine-grained decode sweeps.

### Script crashes on startup

- **Python version:** Requires 3.10+. The launcher checks this automatically, but if you're running `turbo_hardware_diag.py` directly, verify with `python3 --version`.
- **Missing binaries:** The script needs `llama-bench`, `llama-perplexity`, and `llama-cli` in `<llama-dir>/build/bin/`. If any are missing, rebuild llama.cpp.
- **Permissions:** On macOS, `system_profiler` and `pmset` may require user consent the first time. If hardware detection fails, the diagnostic still continues — it just logs warnings.

### Rich terminal UI not showing

If you see plain ASCII instead of color tables, the `rich` package didn't install. This is cosmetic — all results are identical. To fix:

```bash
pip install rich
# Or delete the venv and let turbo-diag recreate it:
rm -rf scripts/.turbo-diag-venv
```

---

## Other Scripts

### turbo-quality-gate.sh

Pre-push quality and speed gate. Run before pushing any TurboQuant changes.

**What it checks:**
1. **Perplexity** — turbo3 PPL must be within 5% of q8_0 baseline (8 chunks of wikitext-2)
2. **Context scaling** — turbo3/q8_0 speed ratio at 4K context must be > 0.95x

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/turbo-quality-gate.sh
# Exit 0 = PASS, Exit 1 = FAIL
```

Configure paths via environment variables: `LLAMA`, `MODEL`, `WIKI`.

### turbo-realworld-bench.sh

Real-world decode benchmark using a long PDF document (70+ pages). Compares turbo3 vs q8_0 at realistic context depths by spinning up `llama-server` instances, sending the full PDF as a prompt, and measuring prefill + decode speed.

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/turbo-realworld-bench.sh [path-to-pdf]
```

**Requirements:** A long PDF file (not included in repo), `pdftotext` (from poppler), and a built llama.cpp with turbo3 support. Configure via `LLAMA`, `MODEL`, `PORT_BASE`, `THREADS`, and `MAX_TOKENS` env vars.
