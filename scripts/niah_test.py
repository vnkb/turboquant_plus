"""TurboQuant Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) Test.

Measures retrieval accuracy across cache types, context depths, and needle counts.
Spins up llama-server for each configuration, inserts unique "needle" facts into
filler text, then queries each needle and scores exact-match retrieval.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/niah_test.py /path/to/llama.cpp /path/to/model.gguf
    python3 scripts/niah_test.py --help

Requirements: Python 3.10+ stdlib only (no pip deps).
