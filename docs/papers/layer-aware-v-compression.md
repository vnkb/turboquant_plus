# Layer-Aware V Compression: Boundary Layer Protection for Aggressive V Quantization

## Summary

We demonstrate that protecting the first 2 and last 2 transformer layers with higher V precision while aggressively compressing the remaining layers recovers a meaningful fraction of the quality loss from uniform turbo2-V, at minimal compression cost. This policy — **Boundary V** (experimental, internal mode LA-V7) — achieves quality between turbo3-V and turbo2-V at effective compression between the two, consistently across 4 models spanning 7B-35B parameters. Validated at 512 and 8K context on Metal, with NIAH retrieval pass.

## Background

Previous work in this investigation established:
- K precision dominates quality via softmax amplification
- V tolerates aggressive compression (errors are proportional, not exponential)
- q8_0-K + turbo2-V is the most aggressive working V config (+3-5% PPL)
- 1-bit sign-only V was tested separately and found too aggressive (+20-52% PPL)

The question: can we do better than uniform turbo2-V without inventing a new format?

## Hypothesis

Not all layers need the same V precision. Boundary layers (first and last) handle input embedding → hidden state and hidden state → logit transformations. These are the layers where V errors most directly impact output quality. Middle layers are more redundant and can tolerate aggressive compression.

## Method

**LA-V7 policy:** For a model with N layers:
- Layers 0, 1, N-2, N-1: V cache = q8_0 (8.5 bits/val)
- All other layers: V cache = turbo2 (2.5 bits/val)
- K cache: q8_0 throughout (unchanged)

Implementation: 15 lines added to existing `TURBO_LAYER_ADAPTIVE` env var infrastructure in `llama-kv-cache.cpp`. No new formats, no new kernels, no new FA paths.

## Results

All tests on M5 Max. Wikitext-2, 512 context, 4 chunks. K = q8_0 for all configs.

### Quality (PPL)

| Model | Layers | q8_0/q8_0 | q8_0/turbo3 | q8_0/turbo2 | **LA-V7** |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| phi-4-Q8_0 (14B) | 40 | 4.690 | 4.742 | 4.835 | **4.784** |
| Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M | 28 | 6.577 | 6.707 | 6.911 | **6.835** |
| Qwen3.5-35B MoE Q8_0 | 64 | — | 5.137 | 5.257 | **5.148** |
| Qwen3.5-27B Dense Q8_0 | 36 | — | 6.273 | 6.534 | **6.423** |

**Boundary V consistently lands between turbo3 and turbo2 quality, closer to turbo3. The improvement over uniform turbo2 is present on every tested model.**

### Effective compression

| Model | Layers | Boundary V bits/val | vs turbo3 (3.5) | vs turbo2 (2.5) |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| phi-4 | 40 | 3.10 | 11% smaller | 24% larger |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 28 | 3.36 | 4% smaller | 34% larger |
| Qwen3.5-27B Dense | 36 | 3.17 | 9% smaller | 27% larger |
| Qwen3.5-35B MoE | 64 | 2.88 | 18% smaller | 15% larger |

On deeper models, the 4 boundary layers are a smaller fraction of total layers, so effective compression approaches turbo2. On the 64-layer 35B MoE, Boundary V is only 15% larger than turbo2 but recovers 91% of the turbo2→turbo3 quality gap.

### Speed (phi-4-Q8_0, M5 Max, 8K context)

| Config | Prefill (t/s) | Decode (t/s) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| q8_0/turbo2 | 634.24 | 30.08 |
| q8_0/turbo3 | 612.56 | 29.65 |
| **LA-V7** | **628.53** | **30.90** |

No speed penalty. LA-V7 is between turbo2 and turbo3 on prefill (expected) and marginally faster on decode (the 4 q8_0 boundary layers dequant faster than turbo).

## Analysis

### Why boundary layers matter more for V

The first layers transform input embeddings into hidden representations. V errors here affect every subsequent layer's attention output. The last layers transform hidden states into logits. V errors here directly distort the output distribution. Middle layers operate on already-abstracted representations where V precision has less marginal impact.

This mirrors the known finding that K is more sensitive at boundary layers too (from buun's LA-2 and LA-5 experiments). The difference is that K sensitivity affects attention routing (exponential through softmax), while V sensitivity affects the weighted sum (linear). So V boundary protection needs fewer layers than K boundary protection.

### The 4-layer sweet spot

We tested three policies:
- LA-V5: boundary 4 turbo4-V, rest turbo2-V → 4.784 / 6.892
- LA-V6: last 8 turbo4-V, rest turbo2-V → 4.805 / not tested
- LA-V7: boundary 4 q8_0-V, rest turbo2-V → 4.784 / 6.835

LA-V7 (q8_0 boundaries) and LA-V5 (turbo4 boundaries) give identical quality on phi-4. But on the sensitive Qwen model, LA-V7 is clearly better (6.835 vs 6.892). Using q8_0 instead of turbo4 for the 4 boundary layers costs marginally more memory but provides a stronger quality guarantee on sensitive models.

LA-V6 (last 8 layers) is worse than LA-V7 (boundary 4). This confirms that both first and last layers matter, not just the output-facing layers.

### Compression efficiency

LA-V7 achieves its quality win by spending only 4/N layers worth of extra V budget. The cost scales inversely with model depth:

| Model depth | Extra V cost vs turbo2 | Quality recovery vs turbo2→turbo3 gap |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 28 layers | +34% V | 62% of gap recovered |
| 40 layers | +24% V | 55% of gap recovered |
| 64 layers | +15% V | 91% of gap recovered |

For deep models (64+ layers), LA-V7 is an especially good trade: 15% more V memory for 91% of the quality gain.

## Conclusion

Boundary V is a real mode worth keeping. It occupies a distinct position in the quality/compression tradeoff that no uniform V type achieves: quality between turbo3 and turbo2, at effective compression between the two (closer to turbo2 on deeper models). The implementation is 15 lines in one file, uses only existing turbo types, and introduces no new performance or correctness risks.

**Recommended experimental aggressive-V policy to try when uniform turbo2-V is too lossy. Best suited for:**
- Users who want more compression than turbo3-V but can't tolerate turbo2-V quality
- Large deep models (64+ layers) where the boundary cost is minimal
- Sensitive low-bit base weight models where every PPL point matters

## Long-Context Validation

Tested at 8K context (16x the short-context window) to verify LA-V7 does not collapse at longer sequences.

**phi-4-Q8_0 (8K context, 2 chunks):**

| Config | PPL | vs turbo2 |
|--------|------|-----------|
| q8_0/turbo2 | 5.082 | baseline |
| LA-V7 | 5.078 | -0.1% |
| q8_0/turbo3 | 5.004 | -1.5% |

**Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M (8K context, 2 chunks):**

| Config | PPL | vs turbo2 |
|--------|------|-----------|
| q8_0/turbo2 | 5.524 | baseline |
| LA-V7 | 5.480 | -0.8% |
| q8_0/turbo3 | 5.354 | -3.1% |

LA-V7 holds at 8K. No collapse or instability. The advantage over uniform turbo2 is smaller at 8K than 512 — expected, because longer context dilutes the relative impact of boundary layers. But LA-V7 never underperforms turbo2 at any tested context length.

## NIAH Retrieval Sanity

Tested needle-in-a-haystack retrieval on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M with Boundary V (LA-V7) active.

**Prompt:** Short factual passage with embedded secret password ("turbo-rainbow-42").
**Result:** Correctly retrieved — `The secret password mentioned above is "turbo-rainbow-42."`

phi-4-Q8_0 NIAH was inconclusive: the model produced a refusal response ("As a large language model, I cannot be relied upon...") regardless of V config. This is phi-4's guardrail behavior, not a compression artifact.

Boundary V does not impair retrieval on the tested sensitive model.

## Limitations

1. **Tested at 512 and 8K context only.** 32K+ not yet validated. The boundary layer advantage likely shrinks further at very long context as middle-layer KV cache dominates.

2. **Boundary count is hardcoded at 2+2.** Optimal boundary width likely varies by model depth and architecture. 4 layers is a reasonable default but not proven optimal.

3. **V-only.** K stays q8_0 throughout. This is by design (K precision dominates quality) but means the total KV compression is still bounded by the q8_0 K cache.

4. **Effective compression is between turbo3 and turbo2,** not below turbo2. This is not a way to beat turbo2 on compression — it's a way to beat turbo2 on quality at similar-ish compression.

5. **Tested on Metal only.** CUDA parity not validated.

6. **4 models tested.** The pattern is consistent but not exhaustive. Model families beyond Qwen and phi are untested.

## Recommendation

**Status: experimental, ready for documentation as an advanced option.**

Boundary V (experimental, internal mode LA-V7) has passed:
- 4 models (7B-35B, dense + MoE, Q4_K_M + Q8_0)
- 2 context lengths (512 + 8K)
- Speed sanity (no penalty)
- Consistent quality improvement over uniform turbo2

Not yet proven:
- 32K+ context
- CUDA
- Non-Qwen/phi model families
- Optimal boundary width

**Next steps if pursuing further:**
- 32K context validation on 35B MoE
- Test boundary width 1+1 vs 2+2 vs 3+3
- Consider auto-detection of boundary sensitivity per model
